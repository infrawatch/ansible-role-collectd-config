Collectd-config-ansible-role
============================

A role that generates collectd configs.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------
The config values have the following naming convention: ``collectd_plugin_<plugin_name>_<config_option>``
The config options for each plugin can be found in the `config guide <https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml>`_.
An incomplete list of supported options is below (list is WIP). To check whether a plugin or config option is set, check the ``templates/<plugin>.conf.j2`` and ``defaults/main/<plugin>.yml``
If there are no defaults set (e.g. all config options are optional), then the ``defaults/main/<plugin>.yml`` will not exist. Otherwise, commented examples are given for the unset, optional config options.


Dependencies
